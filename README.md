#Background

Image-Based Meta- & Mega-Analysis (IBMMA) is a powerful and versatile free software package designed for meta- and mega-analysis on neuroimaging datasets aggregated from multiple study sites. It employs mass-univariate statistical models to analyze diverse neuroimaging features, including voxel-, vertex-, and connectome-based anatomical and functional brain measures.

IBMMA harnesses the power of parallel processing by leveraging multi-CPU capabilities available in modern clusters and personal computers. It boasts the remarkable ability to perform statistical analysis on thousands of subjects and millions of neuroimaging features simultaneously, across various platforms such as Linux, Mac, and Windows. This capability is crucial for analyzing big neuroimaging datasets that far exceed the scale of most single cohort studies prevalent in the past two decades.

One of IBMMA's strengths lies in its modeling flexibility. It not only employs widely-used linear models but also incorporates more sophisticated statistical approaches available in released R and Python packages. This versatility enables researchers to tailor their analyses to specific research questions and data characteristics.

IBMMA produces multiple statistical outputs and model estimations that are consistent with the raw data in terms of dimensionality. This consistency ensures that the results are easily visualized and compared across different models, facilitating comprehensive data analysis and interpretation.

In summary, IBMMA is an optimal tool for big neuroimaging data analysis and displaying statistical results. Its powerful capabilities, versatility, and user-friendly output make it an indispensable asset for researchers working with large-scale neuroimaging datasets from multiple study sites.
